  Hi, my name's Marvin Gregor and I'm a Bible nerd. In the past decade I developed blockbuster video games, pioneered the design technology ARCsheet and peaked when Sony entrusted me with design leadership of their oldest exclusive PlayStation franchise. However, I quit gaming to develop new ways of interacting with the Bible and let people experience scripture in refreshing ways.

  I have worked with a range of different languages and tools. The things I currently have the most experience with are: <mark>LUA</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, <mark>Unreal Engine</mark>, <mark>Anvil/Scimitar</mark> and my favorite <mark>GameMaker</mark> and its <mark>GML Script</mark>.

          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>CSS</mark> and it grew into a full-fledged web-thingy that lets you experience scripture from a different perspective.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
